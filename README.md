# traffic-sign-recognition
This computer vision algorithm recognizes traffic signs for self-driving cars. The model is trained on a Belgian traffic sign data set, in which 32x32 images are loaded as Numpy arrays. For processing, I chose to use a fully connected NN layer, and implementations include the ReLU activation function. The model uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function, which is determined using cross entropy. The code also includes a function to visualize the results.
