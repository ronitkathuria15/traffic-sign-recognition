# traffic-sign-recognition
This computer vision algorithm recognizes traffic signs for self-driving cars. The model is trained on a Belgian traffic sign data set, in which 32x32 images are loaded as Numpy arrays. For processing, I chose to use a fully connected NN layer, and implementations include the ReLU activation function. The model uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function, which is determined using cross entropy.
